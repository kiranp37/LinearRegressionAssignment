## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
    * An MLR model using 14 predictor variables was built, tested and evaluated for various statistical  parameters and LR assumptions. Model is found accurate with following features:

    * R2 for test data: 0.813
    * Residuals are normally distributed with zero mean
    * No autocorrelation between residuals
    * Residuals follows homoscedasticity
    * No multicollinearity between predictor variables
    * Target and predictor variables have a linear relationship
